Scenario: You are developing a machine learning model to classify news articles into
multiple categories such as politics, sports, technology, and entertainment. The dataset
contains thousands of articles, each labeled with one of these categories. The text data
is highly dimensional due to the vast vocabulary and the dataset includes both short and
long articles.
â€¢ Question: Discuss how you would approach building this classifier. What steps would
you take to handle the high dimensionality and variability in article length? Explain your
choice of classification algorithm considering the nature of the data and the need for
model interpretability.

Answer:
I would preprocess the text data by converting it into numeric representations using an encoder.
To handle high dimensionality, I would consider techniques such as PCA (principal component analysis) for
dimensionality reduction. Handling variability in article length can be achieved through padding or truncation.
I would choose Random Forest or Gradient Boosting for classification because they
handle high-dimensional data effectively.


Scenario: You have developed a model to predict whether a customer will default on a loan.
The initial model, a logistic regression, performs adequately, but you believe performance can
be improved.
Question: Describe the steps you would take to optimize this model. What alternative models
might you consider and why? How would you handle the deployment of this model in a
production environment to ensure it remains accurate over time? Discuss how you would set
up a feedback loop for continuous model improvement.

Answer:
I would choose to do feature engineering to create additional features. Evaluate other classification models like
Gradient Boosting because it can capture non-linear relationships between features. I would also consider hyperparameter
tuning can optimize model performance. Deploy the model with robust monitoring for real-time performance tracking.
I would establish a feedback loop to regularly update the model with new data and insights.
